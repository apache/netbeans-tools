===How do I get access to NetBeans sources using Mercurial (hg)?===

First, make sure you have [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ Mercurial] installed on your machine, along with its requirements such as Python.

Then, from the command line, you run
<pre>
hg clone http://hg.netbeans.org/main/
cd main
</pre>
to get the full Platform and IDE sources.  If you also want the <tt>contrib/</tt> modules:
<pre>
hg clone http://hg.netbeans.org/main/contrib/
</pre>

To build, simply run <tt>ant</tt>.
The build will appear in <tt>nbbuild/netbeans/</tt>.
