===How do I register a "ProjectCustomizer" to multiple project types?===
Use the <b>@Registrations</b> annotation to group the multiple <b>@Registration</b> annotations.

For example 
<pre>
@ProjectCustomizer.CompositeCategoryProvider.Registrations({
    @ProjectCustomizer.CompositeCategoryProvider.Registration(projectType = "org-netbeans-modules-java-j2seproject"),
    @ProjectCustomizer.CompositeCategoryProvider.Registration(projectType = "org-netbeans-modules-web-project"),
    @ProjectCustomizer.CompositeCategoryProvider.Registration(projectType = "org-netbeans-modules-maven")
})
public class MyPluginPanelProvider implements ProjectCustomizer.CompositeCategoryProvider {
//...
}
</pre>
