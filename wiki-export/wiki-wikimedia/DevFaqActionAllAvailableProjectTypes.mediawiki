===How determine all available project types?===
* create a new nbm-module using the "''New Project...''"-wizard and choose your target platform
* create a layer.xml using the "''New File...''"-wizard
* expand the nodes "''Important Files/XML Layer/<this layer in context>/Projects''" within the project view
* the direct childnodes of "Projects" are the supported project types of the target platform (see the screenshot below)

The project type can be used for extending the project properties - See [[DevFaqActionAddProjectCustomizer]].
