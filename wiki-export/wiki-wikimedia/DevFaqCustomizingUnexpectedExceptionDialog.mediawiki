== How can I customize the Unexpected Exception dialog ? ==

Problem: How do I add new functionality to the Unexpected Exception dialog?

Solution: First, one needs to create a new class as follows.

The first part of this class is that it must extend <code>Handler</code>:  

<pre>
public class NewFunctionExceptionHandler extends Handler {


    @Override
    public void publish(LogRecord record) {
        if (record.getThrown() != null) {
            // This is an uncaught exception being thrown.
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void flush() {
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws SecurityException {
    }
}
</pre>

In order to properly process the exceptions, one must do a check for the exception in the <code>publish()</code> method; <code>LogRecord</code>s created due to exceptions being thrown will always have <code>Throwable</code>s present.

This class also must implement <code>Callable<JButton></code>.  The button we want displayed in the Uncaught Exception dialog needs to be returned in the call() method:

<pre>
public class NewFunctionExceptionHandler extends Handler implements Callable<JButton> {


    @Override
    public void publish(LogRecord record) {
        if (record.getThrown() != null) {
            // This is an uncaught exception being thrown.
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void flush() {
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws SecurityException {
    }

    // Return the button we want to be displayed in the Uncaught Exception Dialog.
    @Override
    public JButton call() throws Exception {
        ...
    }
}
</pre>

The JButton's action listener needs to be passed the LogRecord that passed via the <code>publish()</code> method. Then, within said action listener for the button, the developer can do what is needed with that record (e.g. Open a Top Component to email a bug report or do anything else).

The final result will look similar to:

<pre>
public class NewFunctionExceptionHandler extends Handler implements Callable<JButton> {

    private JButton newFunctionButton;
    private NewFunctionActionListener newFunctionActionListener = new NewFunctionActionListener();

    @Override
    public void publish(LogRecord record) {
        if (record.getThrown() != null) {
            newFunctionActionListener.setLogRecord(record);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void flush() {
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws SecurityException {
    }

    // Return the button we want to be displayed in the Uncaught Exception Dialog.
    @Override
    public JButton call() throws Exception {
        if (newFunctionButton == null) {
            newFunctionButton = new JButton("Review and Submit Issue");
            newFunctionButton.addActionListener(newFunctionActionListener);
        }

        return reviewIssueButton;
    }

    private class NewFunctionActionListener implements ActionListener {

        private LogRecord logRecord;

        public NewFunctionActionListener() {
        }

        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            // Close our Uncaught Exception Dialog first.
            SwingUtilities.windowForComponent(reviewIssueButton).setVisible(false);
        }

        public void setLogRecord(LogRecord logRecord) {
            this.logRecord = logRecord;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

To register this exception handler, one only needs to add the new <code>Handler</code> to a <code>java.util.Logger</code> named with the empty string:
<pre>
   Logger.getLogger("").addHandler(new NewFunctionExceptionHandler());
</pre>

Any <code>Handler</code> attached to the "" Logger that also <code>implements Callable<JButton></code> will have its button displayed in the Uncaught Exception Dialog.

This could be done in a module's <code>Installer</code> class.
