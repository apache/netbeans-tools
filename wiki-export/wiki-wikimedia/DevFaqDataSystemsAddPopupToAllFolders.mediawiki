===How do I add an item to for every folder in the system?===

There is a folder in the [[DevFaqSystemFilesystem| System Filesystem ]] called Loaders.  It is where various things are registered that apply to specific [[DevFaqDataObject| DataObject ]] types.  For example, there is a folder <tt>Loaders/text/x-java</tt> that contains things that pertain to Java files (notice that the path is a MIME type).  It has an <tt>Actions</tt> subfolder where you can add actions to the popup menu for Java files.

You may not think of a folder as being a file type, but to NetBeans it is.  There is a subfolder <tt>Loaders/folder/any/Actions</tt> which contains actions that should appear in the popup menu for folders.  Just add your action in your [[DevFaqModulesLayerFile| layer file ]] to that folder, i.e.

<source lang="xml">
<filesystem>
  <folder name="Loaders">
      <folder name="folder">
          <folder name="any">
            <folder name="Actions">
               <file name="com-foo-module-MyAction.instance"/>
          </folder>
        </folder>
      </folder>
    </folder>
</filesystem>
</source>
