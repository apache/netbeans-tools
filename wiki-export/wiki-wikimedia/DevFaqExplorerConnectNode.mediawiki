===How do I show a Node to my Explorer View?===

Once you have a component to show [[DevFaqWhatIsANode |  Nodes ]], you will need to set the ''root node'' whose children it will display (some views show the root node, some don't, in some cases you can set whether it does or not).

Presumably you have an [[DevFaqExplorerManager |  ExplorerManager ]] set up for your view - just get that and call <tt>setRootContext (someNode)</tt> and the view will display it.
