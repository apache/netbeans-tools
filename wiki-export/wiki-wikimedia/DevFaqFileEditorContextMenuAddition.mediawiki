===Can I add a menu item to the context menu of the Java source editor?===

Yes. In NetBeans 5.0 and later there is a wizard available for NetBeans modules which does this for you. Just run '''New File | NetBeans Module Development | Action''', as an action type choose '''Conditionally Enabled'''. On the next step choose <tt>text/x-java</tt> in the '''Editor Context Menu Item''' combobox, finish the wizard and you are done. For more information you may press the '''Help''' button available at the bottom of each step of the wizard.

In NetBeans 4.1 you just need to insert an action (e.g. <tt>*.instance</tt> ) into the folder <tt>Editors/text/x-java/Popup/</tt> in your module's XML layer.
