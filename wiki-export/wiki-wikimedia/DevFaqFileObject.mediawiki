===What is a FileObject?===
FileObjects are ''virtual files'' which live inside a [[DevFaqFileSystem| FileSystem ]].  They
may represent a file on disk - or anything else walks and talks like a file, or can be made to - such as a file
on a remote FTP server, a file entry in a JAR file, an entry in an XML file, etc.

FileObjects differ from <tt>java.io.File</tt> in certain ways:
* You don't generally ever have a FileObject representing a file that doesn't really exist (if you think a FileObject may have been deleted, check <code>isValid()</code>)
* You can listen for changes on FileObjects
* <tt>FileObjects</tt> can have key-value pairs of ad-hoc [[DevFaqFileAttributes| attributes ]] associated with them

They are part of the [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/api.html Filesystems API];
the javadoc for FileObject can be found [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html here].
