===I have a .instance file. How do I get an actual object instance?===

Using <tt>InstanceCookie</tt> (note that if you have an entire folder of <tt>.instance</tt> files, there's a [[DevFaqFolderOfInstances| more efficient way ]] to get all of them):

<source lang="java">
DataObject dob = DataObject.find (theDotInstanceFileObject);
InstanceCookie ck = dob.getLookup().lookup(InstanceCookie.class);
MyObject obj = (MyObject) ck.instanceCreate();
</source>

(you can and should call <code>ck.instanceClass()</code> to ensure the type cast is correct ahead of time)

====Alternative:====
<source lang="java">
T obj=FileUtil.getConfigObject("Actions/Window/org-foo-B.instance", T.class) 

//for example:
Action action=FileUtil.getConfigObject("Actions/Window/org-netbeans-core-windows-actions-ResetWindowsAction.instance", Action.class) 
</source>
