====How do I find out which keybindings are already in use?====

For an existing release you can look at e.g. [[KeymapProfileFor60 | KeymapProfileFor60]] to see the specification.

If you are developing a module for NetBeans development builds,
you can just look at
[http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/build/generated/layers.txt this file]
in the section <tt>Shortcuts/</tt>.
This will show all global keybindings being used by modules in the standard IDE
as well as experimental update center
in <tt>http://hg.netbeans.org/main/</tt> and <tt>http://hg.netbeans.org/main/contrib/</tt>
as of a few hours ago.

Editor-specific keybindings are listed in <tt>Editors/*/*/Keybindings/</tt> folders,
which is unfortunately harder to browse through.

Be conservative about adding new keybindings;
they are a precious resource.
Be careful with bindings using <tt>Alt</tt>, as these often clash with mnemonics,
Linux window manager shortcuts, etc.
If at all possible, use a multistroke binding:
for example, <tt>Shortcuts/D-J R C.shadow</tt> binds the 3-stroke sequence <tt>Ctrl-J R C</tt>.
