===How can I add support for <tt>Lookup</tt>s on nodes representing my file type?===

Any object you create can implement <tt>Lookup.Provider</tt>. The simplest way to create a mutable lookup is by using <tt>InstanceContent</tt> and <tt>AbstractLookup</tt>.  Simplified typical usage:

<source lang="java">
public SomeObject implements Lookup.Provider {
   private InstanceContent content = new InstanceContent();
   private final AbstractLookup lkp = new AbstractLookup(content);
   
   public someMethod() {
      ic.set (someCollection...);
   }

   public Lookup getLookup() {
      return lkp;
   }
}
</source>

This is how you create a lookup with dynamic content of your choosing.  See also Tom Wheeler's  [http://www.tomwheeler.com/netbeans/ TodoListManager] for an example of some code that illustrates how to do this.

If you are using <code>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html ProxyLookup]</code> to proxy another (or multiple) lookups, and you want to change the set of Lookups you are proxying on the fly, you will need to subclass <tt>ProxyLookup</tt> and call the protected method [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html#setLookups(org.openide.util.Lookup...) <tt>setLookups(Lookup... lookups)</tt>].
