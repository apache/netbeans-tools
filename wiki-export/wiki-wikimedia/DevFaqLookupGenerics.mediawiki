===How do I use Java Generics with Lookup?===

As of NetBeans 6, a number of convenience methods have been added to lookup, and support for Java generics has been added to Lookup.  The following are differences (assume that <code>lkp</code> is a [[DevFaqLookup| <tt>Lookup</tt>]]):

{| border=1 class="simple" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" style="background-color:#FFF9EF;"
! NB 5.x Code 
! NB 6 Code
|-
| <tt>DataObject dob = (DataObject) lkp.lookup(DataObject.class)</tt>
| <tt>DataObject dob = lkp.lookup(DataObject.class)</tt>
|- 
| <tt>Lookup.Result r = lkp.lookup(new Lookup.Template(X.class))</tt>
| <tt>Lookup.Result<? extends X> r = lkp.lookupResult(X.class)</tt>
|-
|<tt>Collection c = r.allInstances()</tt>
|<tt>Collection<? extends X> c = r.allInstances()</tt>
|-
| <tt>Lookup.Template t = new Lookup.Template(X.class);
Lookup.Result r = lkp.lookup(t);<br/>
Collection c = r.allInstances();</tt>
| <tt>Collection<? extends X> c = lkp.lookupAll(X.class);</tt>
|-
|<tt>Lookup.Template t = new Lookup.Template(X.class);<br/>
Lookup.Result r = lkp.lookup(t);<br/>
Collection c = r.allInstances(); <br/></tt>
<tt>for (Iterator it=c.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;X x = (X) it.next();<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;//do something with x<br/>
}</tt>
|<tt>for (X x : lkp.lookupAll(X.class)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;//do something with x<br/>
}</tt>
|}
<br/>
Generics work well with JDK-5-style for-loops:

<pre>
for (SomeService s : Lookup.getDefault().lookupAll(SomeService.class)) {
    // ...
}
</pre>
