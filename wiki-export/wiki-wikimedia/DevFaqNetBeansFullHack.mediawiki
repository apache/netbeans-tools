==Can I test changes to the IDE without going through the license check and so on?==

If you set the system property <tt>netbeans.full.hack</tt> to <tt>true</tt>,
the following IDE behaviors will be disabled
to make it quicker or more reliable to test other functionality:

* Auto Update background check (to see if updates are available); you can still use AU via '''Tools > Plugin Manager'''
* prompting about still-running tasks when shutting down
* license dialog
* import of old user directory
* IDE registration dialog
* dialog suggesting that you submit usage statistics
* welcome screen displayed by default and RSS feed refreshed
* blocking dialog when some modules could not be loaded
* use of <tt>~/NetBeansProjects/</tt> for newly created projects (<tt>java.io.tmpdir</tt> will be used instead)
* resizing gesture submit dialog (<tt>SubmitStatus.resize</tt>)
* weekly Maven repository indexing (can be configured in Options dialog)
* long package name for default group ID in new Maven project (<tt>test</tt> used instead)

This property is set by default when you:

* run the IDE from sources using <tt>ant tryme</tt>
* run the IDE from a netbeans.org module project using '''Run Project''' (<tt>ant run</tt>)
* run a functional test using <tt>NbModuleSuite</tt> or a unit test using <tt>NbTestCase</tt>

If you need to test one of the suppressed behaviors
(e.g. you are working on the license dialog),
just do not set this property.
For the <tt>ant tryme</tt> and <tt>ant run</tt> cases, add
<pre>
tryme.args=
</pre>
to <tt>nbbuild/user.build.properties</tt> or <tt>~/.nbbuild.properties</tt>.
