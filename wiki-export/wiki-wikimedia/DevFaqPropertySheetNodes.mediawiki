===How do I show my node's properties in the Properties view?===
I want to have the properties of my custom nodes displayed in the Properties view when they are selected in my tree view. How do I go about doing that?

Listen for changes in the selected nodes in the [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.html <tt>ExplorerManager</tt>], and set the <code>activatedNodes</code> property on the parent [[DevFaqWindowsTopComponent| <tt>TopComponent</tt>]] which contains your tree view:
 public class MyComponent extends TopComponent implements PropertyChangeListener {
     private ExplorerManager explorerManager;
 
     public MyComponent() {
         explorerManager = new ExplorerManager();
         explorerManager.addPropertyChangeListener(this);
     }
 
     public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {
         if (evt.getSource() == explorerManager &amp;&amp;
                 ExplorerManager.PROP_SELECTED_NODES.equals(evt.getPropertyName())) {
            setActivatedNodes(explorerManager.getSelectedNodes());
         }
     }
 }
Note that the example above is not a complete <tt>TopComponent</tt> implementation with a tree view and nodes. It is simply demonstrating how to have the selected node's properties shown in the Properties view.
