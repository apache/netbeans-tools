==Should I register an object in my layer file using .instance or .settings files? What about .shadow files or serialization?==

There are a number of kinds of files which are treated (and can be transformed into) instances of objects.

! What
! When to Use It
! How
|-valign="top"
| <code>.instance</code> files
| Almost all the time
| Create a file whose name is the fully qualified name of the class you want to register, with the . characters replaced with - characters and the extension <code>.instance</code> - e.g. <code>&lt;file name=&quot;com-foo-mymodule-MyStatusBarElementProvider.instance&quot;/&gt;</code>.  You can also give the file a different name and instead declare the type using a [[DevFaqFileAttributes|FileObject attribute]], e.g. <blockquote><code>&lt;file name=&quot;x.instance&quot;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;attr name=&quot;instanceClass&quot; stringvalue=&quot;com.foo.mymodule.MyStatusBarElementProvider&quot;/&gt;<br/>&lt;/file&gt; </code></blockquote>
  If you want to use a factory method and set up some configuration of the object using your own [[DevFaqFileAttributes|FileObject attributes]], you can instead <ul><li>Create a public static method on some class, which takes a <code>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html FileObject]</code> as an argument, e.g.<br/><blockquote><code>&lt;file name=&quot;x.instance&quot;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;attr name=&quot;instanceClass&quot; stringvalue=&quot;com.foo.mymodule.MyStatusBarElementProvider&quot;/&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;attr name=&quot;instanceCreate&quot; methodvalue=&quot;com.foo.mymodule.MyStatusBarElementProvider.factoryMethod&quot;/&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;attr name=&quot;yourCustomAttribute&quot; stringvalue=&quot;someValueYouCareAbout&quot;/&gt;<br/>&lt;/file&gt;</code></blockquote>
|-valign="top"
| <code>.settings</code> files
| In specialized situations when the object may be saved back to disk with changed state at runtime and you cannot simply use <code>NbPreferences</code>
| Create an XML file in your module for your settings file, populated as described in [[DevFaqDotSettingsFiles|the .settings file FAQ]].  Register that file in some folder by specifying the XML file as the URL of the <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> entry in your layer, e.g. <code>&lt;file name=&quot;MyObject.settings&quot; url=&quot;theActualFile.xml&quot;/&gt;</code> (in this case, the layer.xml file and the settings file are in the same Java package in your sources).
|-valign="top"
| <code>.shadow</code> files
| If you want your object to be a pseudo-singleton, but it will be registered in multiple folders, or the user may delete the shadow file and you need to provide a way for the user to recover it (i.e. a way to create a new <code>.shadow</code> file)
| <code>[[DevFaqDotShadowFiles| .shadow]]</code> files are like unix symbolic links - they point to another file somewhere else in the [[DevFaqSystemFilesystem| system filesystem]] or on disk, and behave as if they were really that file.  Use one of the other registration mechanisms described here to register your object in some folder.  Then create a shadow file as [[DevFaqDotShadowFiles| described here]] which points to it.<br/> An example of this is Menu and Toolbar actions &mdash; all actions are registered in subfolders of the <code>Actions/</code> folder in the system filesystem.  The user might manually delete or rearrange them;  the UI that allows this can also show all available actions, so that the user can replace accidentally deleted actions.
|-valign="top"
| <code>.ser</code> (serialized object) files
| Basically never
| Write a serialized object out to disk in a file with the extension <code>.ser</code>, either on the fly at runtime into some folder under <code>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileUtil.html#getConfigFile(java.lang.String) FileUtil.getConfigFile()]</code>, or serialize an object ahead of time somehow, copy it into your module sources, and register something like <code>&lt;file name="foo.ser" url="relative/path/in/module/sources/from/layer/dot/xml/to/foo.ser"/&gt;</code>.  Remember that if you use serialization, ''any'' change to the class you serialized is likely to break loading of existing <code>.ser</code> files - this is almost never a good idea.
|-valign="top"
| Your own file type
| Basically never
| Any [[DevFaqDataObject| DataObject]] type which contains an <code>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/cookies/InstanceCookie.html InstanceCookie]</code> (and ideally also an <code>[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/cookies/InstanceCookie.Of.html InstanceCookie.Of]</code>) can be registered in some folder. If this is done <code> [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#forPath(java.lang.String) Lookups.forPath(&quot;path/to/parent/folder&quot;)] </code> can be used to find it and any other objects registered in that folder (whatever their file type).  So you could create your own file type which provides these objects.  <br/>Unless you are doing something very, very unusual, one of the existing registration mechanisms will almost always be sufficient.  <br/>This mechanism may be useful if you have existing code which reads and writes files in some format, and you cannot change that code.
