===I want my module to disable some of the modules that would normally be enabled. Possible?===

If you're building a complete application (for example, selecting the '''Standalone Application''' option for a module suite) just use the '''Libraries''' panel of the suite's '''Properties''' dialog to exclude modules you don't need from clusters you are otherwise including.

If you have a single module which you want to install in an existing application (e.g. the NetBeans IDE) and disable another module, it's a little trickier. You can do it in your <tt>ModuleInstall.restored()</tt> method:

[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-modules/org/openide/modules/doc-files/api.html#listing Modules API - List of Modules]

Sample:

[http://hg.netbeans.org/main/file/tip/versioning.system.cvss/src/org/netbeans/modules/versioning/system/cvss/ModuleLifecycleManager.java ModuleLifecycleManager.java] of the Java CVS Module

You can also go through the Auto Update Services API:
