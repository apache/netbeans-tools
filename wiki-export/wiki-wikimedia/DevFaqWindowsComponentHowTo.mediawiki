===I want to show my own component(s) in the main window - where do I start?===

Use File -> New File wizard, Module Development category and Window Component item. It will generate all necessary background code for you and open GUI Builder to design UI of your own component.

====But what is behind the scenes, created by wizard?====

* Subclass of [[DevFaqWindowsTopComponent| TopComponent]] is created. Design it just as you would a JPanel.
* Simple subclass of <tt>javax.swing.AbstractAction</tt> in created and [[DevFaqActionAddMenuBar| added to main menu]]. It's implemented it to open your component like follows:
<pre>
public class MyAction extends AbstractAction {
   public MyAction() {
      putValue (Action.NAME, "Open My Component");
   }

   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
      new MyComponent().open();
   }
}
</pre>

* Declarative XML descriptions of component are created following [[DevFaqWindowsWstcrefAndFriends| declarative XML API]] principles.

TopComponents are part of the [http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html Windows API].
