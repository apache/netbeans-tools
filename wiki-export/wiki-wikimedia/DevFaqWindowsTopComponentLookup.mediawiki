===Why does <tt>TopComponent</tt> have a <tt>getLookup()</tt> method? What is it for?===

The windowing system is what manages [[DevFaqTrackGlobalSelection| global selection]].  In olden times, selection meant the activated [[DevFaqWhatIsANode| Node]].

In modern NetBeans, the global selection is really whatever objects are in the focused  <tt>[[DevFaqWindowsTopComponent| TopComponent]]</tt>'s [[DevFaqLookup| Lookup]].  It so happens that most standard TopComponents display <tt>[[DevFaqWhatIsANode| Node]]</tt>s - so for most <tt>TopComponent</tt>s, the component's <tt>Lookup</tt> is just proxying the <tt>Lookup</tt> of the selected Node.

Rather than thinking of the selection as some specific object or Node, it is more useful to think of it as a grab bag of stuff provided by whatever component happens to have focus.  If you use <tt>[[DevFaqTrackGlobalSelection| Utilities.actionsGlobalContext()]]</tt>, you do not have to track all the different grab-bags of stuff provided by different components - you can get one grab bag of stuff which whose content will simply change (notifying you in the process) when focus moves to a different component.

So the <tt>TopComponent</tt>'s <tt>Lookup</tt> is a way to provide your particular grab bag of stuff - it can be the lookup of a <tt>Node</tt> if you want, or it can be/contain whatever else or in addition you'd like to put there.
