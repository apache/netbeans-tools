===I have a JCA on file and I have made a code contribution to netbeans.org. Can I get listed on the copyright notice?===

It is impractical to include the names of all contributors to netbeans.org in the copyright notice. Instead, Oracle includes a list of all contributors to the netbeans.org project among others at: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/goto/oca. If you are not listed, and should be, please contact [mailto:jiri.kovalsky@oracle.com Jiri Kovalsky], NetBeans Community Manager.
